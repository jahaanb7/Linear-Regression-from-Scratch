**LINEAR REGRESSION HOUSE PRICE PREDICTOR**

This project implements a multivariable linear regression model from scratch using NumPy.
It predicts house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.

The purpose of this project is to understand how linear regression and gradient descent work internally, without using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.

FEATURES:
  Linear regression implemented from scratch
  Batch gradient descent optimization
  Z-score feature normalization
  Price prediction for custom inputs
  Data visualization using Matplotlib
